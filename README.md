# BusyVazhas 🎯

### Basic Details
- **Team Name**: Vazha
- **Team Members**:
  - **Team Lead**: Adarsh Polsey - St. Joseph’s College, Devagiri (Master of Being “Busy”)
  - **Member 2**: Ayush Jose - St. Joseph’s College, Devagiri (Notification Wizard)
  - **Member 3**: Ashin Sabu - St. Joseph’s College, Devagiri (Chief of Randomness)

### Project Description
- **BusyVazhas** is a groundbreaking app that generates utterly pointless notifications to help you look like the busiest person alive. Need an excuse to avoid a meeting? Done. Want to look important while doing absolutely nothing? We got you! With BusyVazhas, no one will ever suspect you’re just staring blankly into space.

---

### The Problem (that doesn’t exist)
- **Too much peace and quiet**. People are getting judged for appearing relaxed, even though they’re probably drowning in existential dread. Whether you’re trying to dodge that nosy aunt or avoid your professor's gaze, you need *something* to look at on your screen—preferably something absurd.

---

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
- BusyVazhas is here to keep your phone buzzing, vibrating, and demanding attention like an overactive toddler. With notifications like “Your favorite sandwich is 89% complete” or “New friend suggestion: Your Couch,” you’ll always look like you're handling critical business, even if the business is *complete nonsense*.

## Technical Details

- **Technologies/Components Used:**
  - **Software**:
    - **Languages**: Dart, because we’re all about “darting” away from real responsibilities.
    - **Frameworks**: Flutter, to make our nonsense run *smoothly*.
    - **Libraries**: Flutter Local Notifications, to fill your life with alerts you absolutely don’t need.
    - **Tools**: Android Studio, Visual Studio Code, and an unhealthy amount of coffee.

---

## Implementation

- **Installation**: 
   - `flutter pub get` — so you can get all the junk we threw into this app
   - `flutter packages upgrade` — because your app should be up-to-date with all the latest fake alert features.

- **Run**:
   - `flutter run` — get ready to be spammed into oblivion.
